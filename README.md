# Team 15 - Modularized Robotic Arm

## ECEN 403 - Senior Design Project

The Modularized Robotic Arm project is a proof of concept project that's intention is to build a robotic arm that mimics the user's movement so that a professional in their field of work can be put into a high-stake situation without being in a dangerous situation. This brings the skills and experience of humans with the precision and safety of machines.
